 provided by this method. 
Requests that the LogicalDevice cleanly cease all current activity ("Quiesce" input parameter = TRUE) or resume activity (= FALSE). For this method to quiesce a Device, that Device should have an Availability (or Additional Availability) of "Running/Full Power" (value=3) and an EnabledStatus/StatusInfo of "Enabled". For example, if quiesced, a Device may then be offlined for diagnostics, or disabled for power off and hot swap. For the method to "unquiesce" a Device, that Device should have an Availability (or AdditionalAvailability) of "Quiesced" (value=21) and an EnabledStatus/StatusInfo of "Enabled". In this case, the Device would be returned to an "Enabled" and "Running/Full Power" status. 
The method's return code should indicate the success or failure of the quiesce. It should return 0 if successful, 1 if the request is not supported at all, 2 if the request is not supported due to the current state of the Device, and some other value if any other error occurred. In a subclass, the set of possible return codes could be specified, using a ValueMap qualifier on the method. The strings to which the ValueMap contents are 'translated' may also be specified in the subclass as a Values array qualifier.
