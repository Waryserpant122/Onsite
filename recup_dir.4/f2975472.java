" mode, the Device should be restored to its last "Online" state, if at all possible. Only a Device that has an EnabledState/StatusInfo of "Enabled" and has been configured can be brought online or taken offline. 
OnlineDevice should return 0 if successful, 1 if the request is not supported at all, 2 if the request is not supported due to the current state of the Device, and some other value if any other error occurred. In a subclass, the set of possible return codes could be specified, using a ValueMap qualifier on the method. The strings to which the ValueMap contents are 'translated' may also be specified in the subclass as a Values array qualifier. 
Note that this method's function overlaps with the RequestedState property. RequestedState was added to the model to maintain a record (i.e., a persisted value) of the last state request. Invoking the OnlineDevice method should set the RequestedState property appropriately.
