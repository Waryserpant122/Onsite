 replication is established and source/replica elements are associated, but the Copy engine has not started. 
3 - 'PrepareInProgress': Preparation for Replication is in progress and the Copy engine has started. 
4 - 'Prepared': All necessary preparation has completed. 
5 - 'ResyncInProgress': Synchronization or Resynchronization is in progress. This may be the initial 'copy' or subsequent changes being copied. 
6 - 'Synchronized': An Async or Sync replication is currently synchronized. When this value is set, SyncMaintained will be true. 
7 - 'FractureInProgress': An operation to fracture an Async or Sync replication is in progress. 
8 - 'QuiesceInProgress': A quiesce operation is in progress. 
9 - 'Quiesced': The replication has been quiesced and is ready for a change. 
10 - 'RestoreInProgress': An operation is in progress to copy the Synced object to the System object. 
11 - 'Idle': The 'normal' state for an UnSyncAssoc replica. 
12 - 'Broken': The relationship is non-functional due to errors in the source, the target, the path between the two or space constraints. 
13 - 'Fractured': An Async or Sync replication is fractured. 
14 - 'Frozen': All blocks copied from source to an UnSyncAssoc replica and the copy engine is stopped. 
15 - 'CopyInProgress': A deferred background copy operation is in progress to copy the source to the replica target for an UnSyncAssoc association.
