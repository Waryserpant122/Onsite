is case, the Device would be returned to an "Enabled" and "Running/Full Power" status. 
The method\'s return code should indicate the success or failure of the quiesce. It should return 0 if successful, 1 if the request is not supported at all, 2 if the request is not supported due to the current state of the Device, and some other value if any other error occurred. In a subclass, the set of possible return codes could be specified, using a ValueMap qualifier on the method. The strings to which the ValueMap contents are \'translated\' may also be specified in the subclass as a Values array qualifier.
