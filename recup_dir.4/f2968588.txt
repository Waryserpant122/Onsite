DayOfWeek. In one case, RunDay defines the day-in-month on which the Job is processed. This interpretation is used when the DayOfWeek is 0. A positive or negative integer indicates whether the RunDay should be calculated from the beginning or end of the month. For example, 5 indicates the fifth day in the RunMonth and -1 indicates the last day in the RunMonth. 

When RunDayOfWeek is not 0, RunDay is the day-in-month on which the Job is processed, defined in conjunction with RunDayOfWeek. For example, if RunDay is 15 and RunDayOfWeek is Saturday, then the Job is processed on the first Saturday on or after the 15th day in the RunMonth (for example, the third Saturday in the month). If RunDay is 20 and RunDayOfWeek is -Saturday, then this indicates the first Saturday on or before the 20th day in the RunMonth. If RunDay is -1 and RunDayOfWeek is -Sunday, then this indicates the last Sunday in the RunMonth.
