 pool by specifying the UseMaximumSize parameter. Both FriendlyName and Size are treated as goals rather than hard requirements. For example, not all SMI-S based arrays support custom friendly names; however, the virtual disk creation will still succeed. If the size specified is not achieved, the actual size used for the virtual disk will be returned in the out parameter structure. 
The usage of this virtual disk can be set using the Usage and OtherUsageDescription parameters. If a value for OtherUsageDescription is given, Usage must be set to 1 - 'Other', otherwise an error will be returned. 
By default, the resiliency setting applied to this virtual disk will be whatever is specified in the storage pool's ResiliencySettingNameDefault property. This can be overridden using the ResiliencySettingName parameter. Note that the name given here must correspond to a resiliency setting associated with this storage pool. Any other value will result in an error. 
Individual settings of the resiliency setting can be overridden using the NumberOfDataCopies, PhysicalDiskRedundancy, NumberOfColumns, and Interleave parameters. If these parameters are not used, the defaults from the resiliency setting will be used. These overrides will not persist back to the particular resiliency setting instance; however some storage providers may choose to create a new resiliency setting instance to capture this new configuration. If any of the goals specified in the override parameters are out of range, or are not supported by the storage pool, an error will be returned. 
The provisioning policy for the virtual disk is determined in a similar way to the resiliency setting. If no preference is specified in the ProvisioningType parameter, the policy is determined by the storage pool's ProvisioningTypeDefault property. If the ProvisioningType parameter is specified, the default is ignored and the value specified will be used instead. 
Allocation can be further controlled by the PhysicalDisksToUse parameter. There may be certain scenarios where a storage administrator wants to manually choose which physical disks should back the virtual disk. When this parameter is specified, data for the virtual disk will only be stored on the physical disks in this array and not on any others.
