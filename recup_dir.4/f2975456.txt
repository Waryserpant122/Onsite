icable"), should be used. StatusInfo has been deprecated in lieu of a more clearly named property with additional enumerated values (EnabledState), that is inherited from ManagedSystemElement. 
If a Device is ("Enabled")(value=3), it has been powered up, and is configured and operational. The Device may or may not be functionally active, depending on whether its Availability (or AdditionalAvailability) indicate that it is ("Running/Full Power")(value=3) or ("Off line") (value=8). In an enabled but offline mode, a Device may be performing out-of-band requests, such as running Diagnostics. If ("Disabled") StatusInfo value=4), a Device can only be "enabled" or powered off. In a personal computer environment, ("Disabled") means that the Device's driver is not available in the stack. In other environments, a Device can be disabled by removing its configuration file. A disabled device is physically present in a System and consuming resources, but can not be communicated with until a load of a driver, a load of a configuration file or some other "enabling" activity has occurred.
