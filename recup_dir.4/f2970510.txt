RecordFormat string is <empty>, RecordData should be interpreted as a free-form string. 

To describe the data structure of RecordData, the RecordFormat string should be constructed as follows: 
- The first character is a delimiter character and is used to parse the remainder of the string into sub-strings. 
- Each sub-string is separated by the delimiter character and should be in the form of a CIM property declaration (i.e., datatype and property name). This set of declarations may be used to interpret the similarly delimited RecordData property. 
For example, using a \'*\' delimiter, RecordFormat = "*string ThisDay*uint32 ThisYear*datetime SomeTime" 
may be used to interpret: RecordData = "*This is Friday*2002*20020807141000.000000-300".
