ed to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ("Not Applicable"), then this property has no meaning. Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. 
"Unknown" (0) indicates the last requested state for the element is unknown.
Note that the value "No Change" (5) has been deprecated in lieu of indicating the last requested state is "Unknown" (0). If the last requested or desired state is unknown, RequestedState should have the value "Unknown" (0), but may have the value "No Change" (5).Offline (6) indicates that the element has been requested to transition to the Enabled but Offline EnabledState. 
It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are "Reboot" (10) and "Reset" (11). Reboot refers to doing a "Shut Down" and then moving to an "Enabled" state. Reset indicates that the element is first "Disabled" and then "Enabled". The distinction between requesting "Shut Down" and "Disabled" should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. 

This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. 

If knowledge of the last RequestedState is not supported for the EnabledLogicalElement, the property shall be NULL or have the value 12 "Not Applicable".
