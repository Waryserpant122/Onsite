he Actions associated with a PolicyRule may be given a required order, a recommended order, or no order at all. For Actions represented as separate objects, the PolicyActionInPolicyRule aggregation can be used to express an order. 

This aggregation does not indicate whether a specified action order is required, recommended, or of no significance; the property SequencedActions in the aggregating instance of PolicyRule provides this indication.
