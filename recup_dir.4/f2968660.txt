is an integer enumeration that indicates the operational state of a Job. It can also indicate transitions between these states, for example, \'Shutting Down\' and \'Starting\'. Following is a brief description of the states: 
New (2) indicates that the job has never been started. 
Starting (3) indicates that the job is moving from the \'New\', \'Suspended\', or \'Service\' states into the \'Running\' state. 
Running (4) indicates that the Job is running. 
Suspended (5) indicates that the Job is stopped, but can be restarted in a seamless manner. 
Shutting Down (6) indicates that the job is moving to a \'Completed\', \'Terminated\', or \'Killed\' state. 
Completed (7) indicates that the job has completed normally. 
Terminated (8) indicates that the job has been stopped by a \'Terminate\' state change request. The job and all its underlying processes are ended and can be restarted (this is job-specific) only as a new job. 
Killed (9) indicates that the job has been stopped by a \'Kill\' state change request. Underlying processes might have been left running, and cleanup might be required to free up resources. 
Exception (10) indicates that the Job is in an abnormal state that might be indicative of an error condition. Actual status might be displayed though job-specific objects. 
Service (11) indicates that the Job is in a vendor-specific state that supports problem discovery, or resolution, or both.
