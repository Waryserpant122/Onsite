ethod will make use of the CreatedStorageJob out parameter when the request is taking a long time to service. If a storage job has been created to track the operation, this method will return 4096 - 'Method Parameters Checked - Job Started'. Note, even if RunAsJob is TRUE, the method can still return a result if it has finished in sufficient time. 
If FALSE or NULL, this method will follow default WMI asynchronous behavior as determined by the client's method for invocation (i.e. synchronous unless requested otherwise).
