e the same non-zero sequence number, they may be performed in any order, but they must all be performed at the appropriate place in the overall action sequence. 

A series of examples will make ordering of PolicyActions clearer: 
o If all actions have the same sequence number, regardless of whether it is \'0\' or non-zero, any order is acceptable. 
o The values: 
1:ACTION A 
2:ACTION B 
1:ACTION C 
3:ACTION D 
indicate two acceptable orders: A,C,B,D or C,A,B,D, 
since A and C can be performed in either order, but only at the \'1\' position. 
o The values: 
0:ACTION A 
2:ACTION B 
3:ACTION C 
3:ACTION D 
require that B,C, and D occur either as B,C,D or as B,D,C. Action A may appear at any point relative to B, C, and D. Thus the complete set of acceptable orders is: A,B,C,D; B,A,C,D; B,C,A,D; B,C,D,A; A,B,D,C; B,A,D,C; B,D,A,C; B,D,C,A. 

Note that the non-zero sequence numbers need not start with \'1\', and they need not be consecutive. All that matters is their relative magnitude.
