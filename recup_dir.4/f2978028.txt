d with this flag will replace 
             the existing profile. If the new owner already has a profile, calling this method 
             without this flag will fail and return HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS). 
0x00000002 - If the new owner already has a profile, and ReplaceNewOwnerProfile is specified, then 
             specify this flag will delete the replaced profile. Without this flag, the replaced 
             profile is left alone, no user will use that profile automatically, it will not be 
             enumerated either. If ReplaceNewOwnerProfile is not specified, this flag will have 
             no effect.
