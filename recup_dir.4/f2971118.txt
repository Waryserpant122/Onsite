This MOF defines the following keywords: \'UNKNOWN\', \'CONFIGURATION\', \'USAGE\', \'SECURITY\', \'SERVICE\', \'MOTIVATIONAL\', \'INSTALLATION\', and \'EVENT\'. These concepts are self-explanatory and are further discussed in the SLA/Policy White Paper. One additional keyword is defined: \'POLICY\'. The role of this keyword is to identify policy-related instances that may not be otherwise identifiable, in some implementations. The keyword \'POLICY\' is NOT mutually exclusive of the other keywords specified above.
