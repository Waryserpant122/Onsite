t the LogicalDevice be enabled ("Enabled" input parameter = TRUE) or disabled (= FALSE). If successful, the Device's StatusInfo/EnabledState properties should reflect the desired state (enabled/disabled). Note that this method's function overlaps with the RequestedState property. RequestedState was added to the model to maintain a record (i.e., a persisted value) of the last state request. Invoking the EnableDevice method should set the RequestedState property appropriately. 
The return code should be 0 if the request was successfully executed, 1 if the request is not supported and some other value if an error occurred. In a subclass, the set of possible return codes could be specified, using a ValueMap qualifier on the method. The strings to which the ValueMap contents are 'translated' may also be specified in the subclass as a Values array qualifier.
