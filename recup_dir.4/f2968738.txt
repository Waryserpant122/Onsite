"Unknown" indicates the implementation is in general capable of returning this property, but is unable to do so at this time. 
"Not Available" indicates that the implementation (provider) is capable of returning a value for this property, but not ever for this particular piece of hardware/software or the property is intentionally not used because it adds no meaningful information (as in the case of a property that is intended to add additional info to another property). 
"Communication OK " indicates communication is established with the element, but does not convey any quality of service. 
"No Contact" indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it.
