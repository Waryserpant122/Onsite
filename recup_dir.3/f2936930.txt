the job object. 
As a Kernel object job object names are case sensitive.  Because WMI keys are case insensitive, the name of the named job object must be decorated as follows: a capital letter should be preceded by a backslash.  As a consequence of this convention, 'A' and 'a' are lower case and '\A' and '\a' are upper case.
