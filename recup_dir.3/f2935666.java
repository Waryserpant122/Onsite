uration changes, or requested configurations. The CIM_ElementSettingData association is used to model the relationship between a CIM_SettingData instance and the CIM_ManagedElement for which it is a configuration. 
When an instance of CIM_SettingData represents a configuration, the current operational values for the parameters of the element are reflected by properties in the Element itself or by properties in its associations. These properties do not have to be the same values that are present in the SettingData object. For example, a modem might have a SettingData baud rate of 56Kb/sec but be operating at 19.2Kb/sec. 
Note: The CIM_SettingData class is very similar to CIM_Setting, yet both classes are present in the model because many implementations have successfully used CIM_Setting. However, issues have arisen that could not be resolved without defining a new class. Therefore, until a new major release occurs, both classes will exist in the model. Refer to the Core White Paper for additional information. SettingData instances can be aggregated together into higher- level SettingData objects using ConcreteComponent associations.
