tiating Namespace, InstanceID opaquely and uniquely identifies an instance of this class. In order to ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID SHOULD be constructed using the following \'preferred\' algorithm: 
<OrgID>:<LocalID> 
Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon \':\', and where <OrgID> MUST include a copyrighted, trademarked or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity creating/defining the InstanceID, or is a registered ID that is assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness <OrgID> MUST NOT contain a colon (\':\'). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID MUST appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. (For DMTF defined instances, the \'preferred\' algorithm MUST be used with the <OrgID> set to \'CIM\'.) 
<LocalID> MUST include either a vendor specified unique identifier, or if mapping from an ITU M.3100 environment, the trailID, connectionID or subNetworkConnectionID of the instances of PipeR2.
