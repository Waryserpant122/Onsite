s propagated from the the graph of classes that are used to model the resource in the normalized view. The classes may be resource classes or associations. The definition of how a value is propagated (i.e. source class and value transformations) is required to be specified. 
Sub-classes may be explicitly constrained to be read only. If a sub-class is not constrained as read only, the designers are strongly encouraged to carefully consider the data synchronization and consistencies issues that may result. The ElementView association may be used to find the instances that form the normalized view of the managed resource.
