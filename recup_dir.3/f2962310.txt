 responding to commands and is in a normal operating state.
3 - 'Degraded': The volume is responding to commands, but is not running in an optimal operating state.
4 - 'Stressed': The volume is functioning, but needs attention. For example, the volume might be overloaded or overheated.
5 - 'Predictive Failure': The volume is functioning, but a failure is likely to occur in the near future.
6 - 'Error': An error has occurred.
7 - 'Non-Recoverable Error': A non-recoverable error has occurred.
8 - 'Starting': The volume is in the process of starting.
9 - 'Stopping': The volume is in the process of stopping.
10 - 'Stopped': The volume was stopped or shut down in a clean and orderly fashion.
11 - 'In Service': The volume is being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered.
12 - 'No Contact': The storage provider has knowledge of the volume, but has never been able to establish communication with it.
13 - 'Lost Communication': The storage provider has knowledge of the volume and has contacted it successfully in the past, but the volume is currently unreachable.
14 - 'Aborted': Similar to Stopped, except that the volume stopped abruptly and may require configuration or maintenance.
15 - 'Dormant': The volume is reachable, but it is inactive.
16 - 'Supporting Entity in Error': This status value does not necessarily indicate trouble with the volume, but it does indicate that another device or connection that the volume depends on may need attention.
17 - 'Completed': The volume has completed an operation. This status value should be combined with OK, Error, or Degraded, depending on the outcome of the operation.
0xD00D - 'Scan Needed': In Windows-based storage subsystems, this indicates a scan is needed but not repair.
0xD00E - 'Spot Fix Needed': In Windows-based storage subsystems, this indicates limited repair is needed.
0xD00F - 'Full Repair Needed': In Windows-based storage subsystems, this indicates full repair is needed.
