a concrete pool. Storage pools are required to follow the assigned policy for a physical disk. 
1 - 'Auto-Select': This physical disk should only be used for data storage. 
2 - 'Manual-Select': This physical disk should only be used if manually selected by an administrator at the time of virtual disk creation. A manual-select disk is selected using the PhysicalDisksToUse parameter to CreateVirtualDisk. 
3 - 'Hot Spare': This physical disk should be used as a hot spare. 
4 - 'Retired': This physical disk should be retired from use. At a minimum, no new allocations should go to this disk. If the virtual disks that reside on this disk are repaired, the data should be moved to another active physical disk.
