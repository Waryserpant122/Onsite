Disabled (3) indicates that the element will not execute commands and will drop any new requests. 
Shutting Down (4) indicates that the element is in the process of going to a Disabled state. 
Not Applicable (5) indicates the element doesn't support being enabled/disabled. 
Enabled but Offline (6) indicates that the element may be completing commands, and will drop any new requests. 
Test (7) indicates that the element is in a test state. 
Deferred (8) indicates that the element may be completing commands, but will queue any new requests. 
Quiesce (9) indicates that the element is enabled but in a restricted mode. The element's behavior is similar to the Enabled state, but it only processes a restricted set of commands. All other requests are queued.
