 value to change, without reusing earlier values for a sufficiently long time.
When retrying the delivery of an indication, this property shall have the same value as in the original delivery.
To guarantee this uniqueness, the property value should be constructed using the following format (defined in ABNF): sequence-context = indication-service-name "#" cim-service-start-id "#" listener-destination-creation-time
Where: indication-service-name is the value of the Name property of the CIM_IndicationService instance responsible for delivering the indication. cim-service-start-id is an identifier that uniquely identifies the CIM service start, for example via a timestamp of the start time, or via a counter that increases for each start or restart. listener-destination-creation-time is a timestamp of the creation time of the CIM_ListenerDestination instance representing the listener destination.
Since this format is only a recommendation, CIM clients shall treat the value as an opaque identifier for the sequence context and shall not rely on this format.
