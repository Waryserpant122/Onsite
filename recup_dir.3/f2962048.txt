at the subsystem is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 
5 - 'Predictive Failure': indicates that the subsystem is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 
11 - 'In Service': describes a subsystem being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 
12 - 'No Contact': indicates that the storage provider has knowledge of this subsystem, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 
13 - 'Lost Communication': indicates that the subsystem is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 
10 - 'Stopped' and 14 - 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the subsystem might need to be updated. 
15 - 'Dormant': indicates that the subsystem is inactive. 
16 - 'Supporting Entity in Error': indicates that this subsystem might be OK, but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error.
