ed by EnabledState. This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled/disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ("Not Applicable"), then this property has no meaning. By default, the element's RequestedState is 5 ("No Change"). Refer to the EnabledState's property Description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. 

It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are "Reboot" (10) and "Reset" (11). The former, Reboot, refers to doing a "Shut Down" and then moving to an "Enabled" state. The latter, Reset, indicates that the element is first "Disabled" and then "Enabled". The distinction between requesting "Shut Down" and "Disabled" should also be noted. The former, Shut Down, requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and MAY involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The latter, the Disabled state, requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. 

This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or may be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, since it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. 

It is possible that a particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement may not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ("Not Applicable") is used.
