lement is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 
"Stopped" and "Aborted" are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the element's state and configuration may need to be updated. 
"Dormant" indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 
"Supporting Entity in Error" describes that this element may be "OK" but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower layer networking problems. 
"Completed" indicates the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can till if the complete operation passed (Completed with OK), and failure (Completed with Error). Completed with Degraded would imply the operation finished, but did not complete OK or report an error. 
"Power Mode" indicates the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. 
OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier since it required the DEPRECATED qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that providers/instrumentation provide BOTH the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus SHOULD contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (since it is single-valued) SHOULD also provide the primary status of the element.
