operty names to avoid ambiguity - since a CIM Service, Namespace or Collection could manage multiple classes. On the other hand, if the authorization target is an individual instance, then there is no possible ambiguity and the class name may be omitted. To specify ALL properties, the wildcard string "*" should be used. 
- 4=<Class.>Method. This example is very similar to the Property one, above. And, as above, the string "*" may be specified to select ALL methods. 
- 5=Object Reference. Example: If the authorization target is a CIM Service or Namespace, then the ActivityQualifiers entries can define a list of object references (as strings) that the authorized subject can access. 
- 6=Namespace. Example: If the authorization target is a CIM Service, then the ActivityQualifiers entries can define a list of Namespaces that the authorized subject is able to access. 
- 7=URL. Example: An authorization target may not be defined, but a Privilege could be used to deny access to specific URLs by individual Identities or for specific Roles, such as the 'under 17' Role. 
- 8=Directory/File Name. Example: If the authorization target is a FileSystem, then the ActivityQualifiers entries can define a list of directories and files whose access is protected. 
- 9=Command Line Instruction. Example: If the authorization target is a ComputerSystem or Service, then the ActivityQualifiers entries can define a list of command line instructions that may or may not be 'Executed' by the authorized subjects.
