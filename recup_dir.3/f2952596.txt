f the processor. bits 0-6 of the field contain the processor's current voltage times 10. This value is only set when SMBIOS designates a voltage value. For specific values, see VoltageCaps.
Example: field value for a processor voltage of 1.8 volts would be 92h = 80h + (1.8 x 10) = 80h + 18 = 80h + 12h.
