If the physical disk is not a member of a concrete pool, then this method should not only reset the health and operational statuses, but it should return the disk into a state where it is usable as storage for a concrete pool. For example: If a physical disk had become missing and then has reappeared (after it has been replaced) this physical disk is expected to be in the primordial pool only with an operational status indicating its data is either split or unrecognized. Calling Reset should clear the physical disk of any data, remove any remaining ties to its former concrete pool, and return the disk to a healthy, usable state.
